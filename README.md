--Project 5: Neighborhood Map--

This is a map borrowed from Google's API that provides localities within the National Mall of Washington DC.

To view the web page, click the index.html file within the main folder.

There is a search box implemented to search areas within the map's coordinates.

There are listed items on the right side of the map with pre-selected popular locations gathered from the Foursquare API.

Each of those locations listed have location markers on the screen.

If a location marker is clicked, the locations's name and address will populate in a box.

If a location is clicked from the Places box on the right, the location's marker will animate and a box will appear containing info collected from Foursquare's API.

The map is fully functional to the point where the zoom and pan functions can still be utilized to go to other locations.
